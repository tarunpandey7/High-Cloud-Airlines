# ✈️ High Cloud Airlines – Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **High Cloud Airlines Data Analytics Project** focuses on analyzing airline operational and passenger performance using real-world flight data.  
The objective is to evaluate seat utilization, passenger demand, route efficiency, and seasonal travel patterns to support **data-driven decision-making** in the airline industry.

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis skills using **SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Measure airline performance using key operational KPIs  
- Analyze **Load Factor** to understand seat utilization efficiency  
- Identify passenger demand trends and seasonal patterns  
- Evaluate carrier-wise and route-wise performance  
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations for optimization  

---

## 📊 Key KPIs Analyzed
- **Load Factor (%)**
- **Total Flights Operated**
- **Total Passengers Carried**
- **Average Distance per Flight**
- **Average Air Time**
- Load Factor by:
  - Year, Quarter, and Month
  - Carrier Name
  - Weekday vs Weekend
- Flight distribution by distance groups

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data extraction, transformation, and KPI calculations  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Preliminary analysis and summary dashboards  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and advanced visual analysis  
- **Tableau** – Visual storytelling and trend analysis  

---

## 📈 Dashboards Created
- **Excel Dashboard** – High-level KPI overview  
- **Power BI Dashboard** – Interactive analysis with filters and slicers  
- **Tableau Dashboard** – Clear visualization of trends and comparisons  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Average **Load Factor of 76.8%**, indicating healthy seat utilization  
- Strong **seasonality**, with peak demand during mid-year (Q3)  
- Short and medium-haul flights dominate airline operations  
- Major city routes such as New York–Atlanta and Boston–New York show highest traffic  
- Some carriers achieve very high load factors, while others show operational inefficiencies  
- Balanced demand observed across weekdays and weekends  

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Implement **dynamic pricing and promotions** during low-demand periods  
- Optimize or re-evaluate underperforming routes and carriers  
- Focus on **cost efficiency** for short-haul, high-frequency routes  
- Increase capacity on top-performing routes during peak seasons
